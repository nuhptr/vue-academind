## Taking Notes

-  [x] `v-model.lazy` means that the input's value will be updated after the `change` event is triggered instead of `input` event.
-  [x] `v-model.number` means that the input's value will be converted to a number type.
-  [x] `v-model.trim` means that the input's value will be trimmed automatically.
