# Http Request Notes

The HTTP request is a message sent by the client to the server. The message consists of a request line, headers, and a body. The request line contains the method, the URL, and the HTTP version. The headers contain additional information about the request, such as the host, the user-agent, and the content type. The body contains the data sent by the client, such as form data or a file upload.
