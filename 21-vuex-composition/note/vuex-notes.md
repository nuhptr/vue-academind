## Vuex Composition Notes

Vuex is a state management library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. Vuex also integrates with Vue's official devtools extension, providing advanced features such as zero-config time-travel debugging and state snapshot export/import.
